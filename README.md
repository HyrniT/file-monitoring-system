# 👀 File Monitoring System - Version 1.1

## ❤️ This is my Java project at HCMUS, includes the following main functions:

* Server can monitor any directory that client sends

* Server can choose a file or a subdirectory in the directory the client sends to monitor

* Any action of adding, deleting and editing in that directory at client will send a notification to the server

* Server can monitor multi-client, each client monitor only one directory

## ❤️ And, some extended functions:

* Chat

* Export log.txt

* Notify client when server is down and vice versa

## ✌️ Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## 🔗 Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
